    not accept unsolicited submissions of concepts, creative ideas, suggestions, stories, or other potential content.
    This is to avoid the possibility of future misunderstanding when projects developed by HBO staff or representatives
    might seem to others to be similar to the submitted concepts, creative ideas, suggestions, stories or other
    potential content. Therefore, please do not send HBO any unsolicited submissions.<br><br>(b) From time to time,
    areas on this Service may expressly request submissions of concepts, creative ideas, suggestions, stories, or other
    potential content from you ("Invited Submissions"). Where this is the case, please carefully read any specific rules
    or other terms and conditions which appear elsewhere on this Service to govern the Invited Submissions ("Additional
    Terms"), since they will affect your legal rights. If no Additional Terms govern the Invited Submissions, then this
    Agreement will apply in full to any Invited Submissions you make. Please also be aware that any Invited Submissions
    you may make will not be acknowledged and the act of providing Invited Submissions does not create a fiduciary or
    other special relationship between you and HBO, or any of its affiliates, agents, licensees, successors or assigns
    or place HBO or any of its affiliates, agents, licensees, successors or assigns in a position that is any different
    from the position held by members of the general public. You acknowledge and agree that neither HBO nor any of its
    affiliates, agents, licensees, successors or assigns has now, or shall have in the future, any duty or liability,
    direct or indirect, vicarious, contributory or otherwise, with respect to the infringement or protection of any
    copyright in and to your Invited Submissions, and that HBO and its affiliates, agents, licensees, successors or
    assigns are not responsible for the loss, deletion, failure to store or misdelivery of any Invited
    Submissions.<br><br>(c) To the extent that use of the Service provides you or other users an opportunity to post and
    exchange information, content, ideas and opinions ("Postings"), be advised that HBO does not screen, edit, or review
    Postings prior to their appearance on the Service or elsewhere, and Postings do not necessarily reflect the views of
    HBO. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, HBO excludes all responsibility and liability for the
    Postings or for any losses or expenses resulting from their use and/or appearance on the Service or elsewhere. You
    hereby represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights in and to all Postings you provide and all material,
    content and information they contain and that such Postings shall not infringe any proprietary right, intellectual
    property right or other rights of third parties.<br><br>(d) In any event, no material you send to us will be treated

    Terms will determine how we will treat your Invited Submissions.<br><br>(b) Subject to the provisions of any

    refer to any act of God, storm, fire, casualty, unanticipated work stoppage, power outage, satellite failure,
    strike, lockout, labor dispute, civil disturbance, riot, war, national emergency, Governmental action, or other
    cause beyond its control.<br><br>22. <b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION AND NO CLASS RELIEF</b><br><br>(a)
    Except with regard to the enforceability of the arbitration agreement contained herein, which shall be governed by
    the Federal Arbitration Act (as set forth below in subsection 22(d) below), this Agreement shall be governed by,
    construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, as they are applied to agreements
    entered into and to be performed entirely within New York and without regard to conflict of law principles.<br><br>(b)
    Except in relation to intellectual property rights as set forth in subparagraph (e) below, we each agree to resolve
    disputes through binding arbitration with no class relief instead of in courts. Arbitration is more informal than a
    lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited
    discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Any arbitration under this Agreement will
    take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.<br><br>(c) Any dispute,
    claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Service or your use of the Service, including the website,
    user interface, these Terms and this Arbitration Agreement, and the HBO Privacy Policy, must be filed within one
    year of the relevant events. You waive - that is, give up your right to pursue - any dispute, claim or controversy
    that is not filed within one year and any right you may have had to pursue that dispute, claim or controversy in any
    forum is permanently barred.<br><br>(d) Except as set forth in subparagraph (e) below, HBO and you agree that any
    dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Service or your use of the Service, including the
    website, user interface, these Terms and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined on an individual basis,
    without class relief, by binding arbitration instead of courts of general jurisdiction. This agreement to arbitrate
    is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:<br><br>(i) claims arising out of or
    relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
    misrepresentation or any other legal theory;<br><br>(ii) claims that arose before this or any prior
    Agreement;<br><br>(iii) claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.<br><br>References in this
    paragraph to "HBO," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors
    in interest, licensees, licensors or providers of content, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or
    unauthorized users of the Service under this or prior Agreements. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you
    from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows,
    seek relief against us on your behalf.<br><br>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and HBO are each
    waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in
    interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
    provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.<br><br>A party who intends to
    seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by other mail
    delivery service that provides proof of delivery (e.g., FedEx), a written notice of dispute ("Notice"). The Notice
    to HBO should be addressed to: General Counsel, Home Box Office, Inc., 1100 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY
    10036 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set
    forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If HBO and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 60
    days after the Notice is received, you or HBO may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the
    amount of any settlement offer made by HBO or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
    arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or HBO is entitled.<br><br>If your claim is for less than
    $75,000, upon written request to the Notice Address prior to commencement of the arbitration, HBO will advance the
    arbitration filing fee and arbitrator's costs by direct payment to the appropriate entity. If the arbitration
    proceeding is decided in HBO's favor, you shall reimburse HBO for the fees and costs advanced to the extent
    available in a judicial proceeding. If the arbitration is decided in your favor - which occurs if there is an award
    to you that is greater than the value of HBO's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected
    - you will not be required to reimburse HBO for any of the fees and costs advanced.<br><br>The arbitration will be
    governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
    (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will
    be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
    The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement, including Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of
    Liability. The arbitrator shall have the right to award money damages and other appropriate relief, consistent with
    the terms of this agreement; HOWEVER THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO AWARD INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST
    EITHER PARTY OR TO CERTIFY A CLASS ACTION OF ANY KIND.<br><br>All issues are for the arbitrator to decide. Unless
    HBO and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place either (i) in person in the county (or parish)
    of the billing address associated with your subscription according to your Distributor, whose records shall be the
    sole determinant, or in New York, New York, at your option, or (ii) by video conference during which you shall be
    able to appear from the county (or parish) of the billing address associated with your subscription according to
    your Distributor, whose records shall be the sole determinant, or any other location of your choosing which has
    appropriate video conference facilities available. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, there shall be no in person
    hearing; and we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents
    submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by video conference as established by the AAA Rules.
    If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to and format of a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless
    of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision
    sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.<br><br>Each party shall be
    responsible for their own attorneys' fees. Although under some laws HBO may have a right to an award of attorneys'
    fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, HBO agrees that it will seek such an award only in the event
    that the substance of your claim or the relief sought has been deemed by the arbitrator to be frivolous or brought
    for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).<br><br>YOU
    AND HBO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A
    PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and HBO
    agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside
    over any form of a representative or class proceeding.<br><br>(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes enforcing,
    protecting, or concerning the validity of any of your or HBO's intellectual property rights (or the intellectual
    property rights of any of HBO's licensors) are not covered by this agreement to arbitrate contained in paragraph 22.<br><br>(f)
    If the waiver of the right to participate in a class action set forth in subparagraphs (b) and (d) above is found to
    be illegal or unenforceable for any reason whether by judicial, legislative, or other action, than the entirety of
    the agreement to arbitrate contained in paragraphs (b) and (d) is null and void. In that instance, you and HBO agree
    to waive your right to a jury trial. You and HBO further agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of
    or relating to the Service or your use of the Service, including the website, user interface, and these Terms of Use
    shall be brought in the appropriate state or federal court located in New York County, New York; and that we both
    irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in New York County, New
    York.<br><br>23. <b>EXPORT CONTROL:</b> You may not use or otherwise export or re-export any software associated
    with the Service except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the software
    was obtained. In particular, but without limitation, the software may not be exported or re-exported into any U.S.
    embargoed countries or to any persons listed as prohibited under applicable law or regulation.<br><br>24. <b>MISCELLANEOUS:</b>
    These Terms cannot be changed or terminated orally. Any failure of HBO to exercise or enforce any right or provision
    of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by HBO of any provision of these
    Terms will be of any force or effect unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of HBO. HBO may
    assign its rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any
    notice. These Terms may not be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under them, without the prior
    written consent of an officer of HBO. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid, or
    unenforceable, then the provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and
    enforceability of any remaining provisions. The section titles in this Agreement are inserted only as a matter of
    convenience and have no legal or contractual effect. You agree that these Terms will not be construed against HBO by
    virtue of HBO having drafted them. HBO reserves the right to deny access to all or part of the Service to you or any
    person in its sole discretion without notice or liability of any kind. Any violation of these Terms may be referred
    to law enforcement authorities. These Terms constitute the entire understanding and agreement between you and HBO
    and supersede any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Service and your use of the
    Service.<br><br>25. <b>CLOSED CAPTIONING:</b> If you have specific concerns or inquiries regarding closed
